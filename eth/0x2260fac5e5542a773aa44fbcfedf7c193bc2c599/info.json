 "description": "WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is an ERC20 token pegged to Bitcoin, jointly launched by blockchain projects such as BitGo, Kyber Network, and Ren. This token is issued on Ethereum, achieving a 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. Every issued WBTC is backed by Bitcoin, and each Bitcoin stored by the custodian corresponds to the total number of WBTC issued, which can be verified on-chain. Custodians can mint WBTC only with merchants' approval, and WBTC will be burned when holders exchange it for Bitcoin.",
