 "description": "RoE (Realms of Ethernity) is the next generation free-to-play MMORPG experience. We believe in game design principles that cultivate decentralized player-driven communities, where you can form life-long relationships by embarking on epic quests and adventures. Through instant accessibility we strive to give everyone the opportunity to experience the unique world of Ethernity. Finally, we believe in empowering players, by sharing the revenue generated on Ethernity with our community through true ownership of digital assets. The RETH token is designed to be the main token of the game, used for trading in-game valuable NFT assets and items, while players will risk their lives fighting monsters or complete quests for the in-game gold coins. This separate use of token and in-game currency works to fuel the incentives to play and secures our players with a stable and sustainable economy - which is of top priority when we design the game. $RETH holders will be also able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of The Ethernity ecosystem.",
