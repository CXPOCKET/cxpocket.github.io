 "description": "Arbitrum is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution for Ethereum. The protocol uses optimistic rollups to enhance Ethereum's speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Arbitrum benefits from Ethereum's security and compatibility. Another advantage is a higher transaction throughput and lower fees than Ethereum. This is achieved by offloading most computational and storage workload off-chain.",
