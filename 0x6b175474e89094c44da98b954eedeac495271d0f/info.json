 "description": "Dai is the largest decentralized stablecoin on Ethereum, developed and managed by MakerDAO, serving as a foundational infrastructure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Dai is issued backed by a full collateralization of on-chain assets, maintaining a 1:1 peg with the USD, so 1 Dai equals 1 dollar. Individuals and businesses can hedge assets and access liquidity by exchanging or borrowing Dai. Dai has been applied in collateralized loans, margin trading, international transfers, supply chain finance, etc. The Maker Protocol, also known as the Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) system, allows users to generate Dai by collateralizing assets approved by 'Maker Governance'. Maker Governance is a community-run and operated process used to manage various aspects of the Maker Protocol. Dai is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency tied to the dollar. Dai's low volatility can resist severe inflation, providing economic freedom and opportunities to anyone anywhere.",
